## Authors

Group CXX

_preencher com nome, número e GitHub ID de membro do grupo e depois apagar esta linha_

For each module, the README file must identify the lead developer and the contributors.
The leads should be evenly divided among the group members.


### Code identification

In all the source files (including POMs), please replace __CXX__ with your Campus: A (Alameda) or T (Tagus); and your group number with two digits.

This is important for code dependency management 
i.e. making sure that your code runs using the correct components and not someone else's.


## Getting Started

The overall system is composed of multiple servers and clients.
The main server is _depot_ that is aided by _sentry_. 
The clients are _seeker_ and _feeder_.

See the project statement for a full description of the domain and the system.



### Prerequisites

Java Developer Kit 8 or 11 is required running on Linux, Windows or Mac.
Maven 3 is also required.

To confirm that you have them installed, open a terminal and type:

```
javac -version

mvn -version
```


### Installing

To compile and install all modules:

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

The tests are skipped because they require each server to be running.
